The __LabilityBootstrap__ module enables manual deployment of (virtual) machines using
[__Lability__](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability) configuration data. This makes
it possible to use the same lab/testing configuration documents outside of the standard
[__Lability__](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability) local Hyper-V host deployment
model; for example using VMware Workstation or Oracle VirtualBox.

[__Lability__](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability) automatically injects the required certificates, file (DSC and custom)
resources and configuration files into a VM's VHD(X) file during the provisioning
process. __LabilityBootstrap__ works by creating a self-contained .ISO file containing
all the required resources. This resulting .ISO file can then be mounted within each
(virtual) machine to manually bootstrap a node's deployment.

_Note: it is possible to manually bootstrap virtual machine in either Amazon Web Services or
Microsoft Azure!_
